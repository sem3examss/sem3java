Stop words are available in abundance in any human language. By removing these words, we remove the 
low-level information from our text in order to give more focus to the important information . 
In order words , we can say that the removal of such words does not show any negative consequences 
on the model we train for our task . Removal of stop words definitely reduces the dataset size and 
thus reduces the training time due to the fewer number of tokens involved in the training .
